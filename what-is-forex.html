        <h1>What Is the Forex Market?</h1>
        <p>The foreign exchange market, often called forex, is where people trade different currencies. Think of it like trading money when you travel to a foreign country.</p>

        <p>What's unique about forex is that there's no one big building where trading happens. Instead, traders all around the world use computers to trade with each other.</p>

        <p>Forex is open 24 hours a day, five and a half days a week. This means that when one trading center closes, another one opens. So, you can trade almost anytime you want, even at night!</p>

        <p>Traders in big cities like London, New York, Tokyo, and more are busy buying and selling currencies. They're trying to make a profit by guessing which way currency prices will go.</p>

        <p>It's like trying to predict whether the price of your favorite game will go up or down. If you're right, you make money!</p>
